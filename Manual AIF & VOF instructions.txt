1. Load the DSC dicoms by using "dsc = loadDSC('folder containing DSC')".

2. Use 'AIFviewer.m' function to browse through DSC ("AIFviewer(dsc)").

3. Click on the 'ROI AIF' button to draw an ROI, then click on 'Save ROI'.

4. ROI will be saved in MATLAB workspace as 'aif_roi'. Rename this variable to 'aifmask' and save it as 'AIF_Mask_P001GE_M.mat' in the folder that contains the 'P001' folder.

5. Draw an ROI for VOF and rename the new 'aif_roi' to 'veinmask'. And save it as 'Vein_Mask_P001GE_M.mat' in the same folder as above.
